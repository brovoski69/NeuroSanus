**NeuroSanus** is a Pain Neuroscience Simulator designed as an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) project**.  
It helps users understand and manage chronic pain using modern neuroscience principles such as neuroplasticity and graded motor imagery.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Traditional pain management apps focus only on symptoms.  
NeuroSanus focuses on **education + neural retraining**, helping users understand that:

> Pain is an output of the brain, not just a signal of tissue damage.

This project demonstrates how software can model complex real-world systems using **object-oriented design**.
